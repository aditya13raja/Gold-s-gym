                <b><span class="qna">Q:</span> Muscle weighs more than fat. True or False?</b><br />
                <b><span class="qna">A:</span> False</b>. A pound is a pound regardless of whether
                    the pound is fat or muscle. The truth about muscle is that it's denser
                    than fat and takes up a smaller amount of space in the body. In fact,
                    scientists estimate that 1 pound of muscle occupies about 22% less space
                    than 1 pound of fat!

                <b><span class="qna">Q:</span> Maintaining physical fitness requires major lifestyle 
                    changes. True or False?</b><br />
                <b><span class="qna">A:</span> FAlse</b>.Fitness can be achieved through small changes
                    in what you eat and your level of activity. It's really that simple. Remember that you
                    can start out slowly; work your way up to a higher level of activity, and implement 
                    more dietary changes over time. Patience is essential. Don't try to do too much too 
                    soon, and don't quit before you have a chance to experience the rewards of improved 
                    fitness and a healthy diet!

                <b><span class="qna">Q:</span> <q>No pain, no gain</q> is a workout myth. True or False?</b><br />
                <b><span class="qna">A:</span> True</b>. <q>No pain, no gain</q> is a workout myth because while 
                    some muscle aches and pains are normal when beginning a new fitness routine, many types of pain 
                    are bad for you. According to Jeffrey Berg, an orthopedic surgeon and team physician for the 
                    Washington Redskins, <q>There are other aches and pains, such as joint pain, bone pain, muscle 
                    strains, and ligament or tendon strains, which are bad, and you should back off of because 
                    they'll get worse if you ignore them.</q> He adds, <q>Always ease into an exercise plan to avoid 
                    injury. The recommendation is if you're healthy and you know it, you can start exercising, but 
                    err on the side of being too slow than too fast to avoid injury.</q>

                <b><span class="qna">Q:</span> Weight loss should be the most important goal of fitness and 
                    exercise. True or False?</b><br />
                <b><span class="qna">A:</span> False</b>. It's a fact that weight loss is the main reason people 
                    exercise at all, but losing weight is certainly not the only benefit of exercising and should 
                    therefore not be the main goal. If you're starting a fitness program, don't make weight loss 
                    your only goal! Strive to feel better or to have more energy. You'll get more out of your 
                    program if you notice the small payoffs that exercise provides in a very short amount of time.

                <b><span class="qna">Q:</span> You should warm up before exercising. True or False?</b><br />
                <b><span class="qna">A:</span> True</b>. Each workout should begin with a warm-up. A warm-up 
                    should include 5 to 10 minutes of exercise such as walking, slow jogging, knee lifts, arm 
                    circles, and/or trunk rotations. Warming up is important to help prevent injury. It also 
                    helps to maximize benefits from exercise.
